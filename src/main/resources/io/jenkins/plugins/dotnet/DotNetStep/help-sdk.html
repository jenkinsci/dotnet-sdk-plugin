<div>
  Name of a .NET SDK to use so that <code>dotnet</code> will be in the path.<br/>
  If the default is specified, you either need to use the <q>With .NET</q> element (or a <code>withDotNet</code> block in a
  pipeline script) to specify one, or ensure this step runs on a node that has a .NET SDK installed and in the path.
