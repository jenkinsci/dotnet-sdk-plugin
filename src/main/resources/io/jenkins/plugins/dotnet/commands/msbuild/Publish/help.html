  <code>dotnet publish</code> compiles the application, reads through its dependencies specified in the project file, and publishes
  the resulting set of files to a directory. The output includes the following assets:
  <ul>
    <li>Intermediate Language (IL) code in an assembly with a <em>dll</em> extension.</li>
    <li>A <em>.deps.json</em> file that includes all of the dependencies of the project.</li>
    <li>
      A <em>.runtimeconfig.json</em> file that specifies the shared runtime that the application expects, as well as other
      configuration options for the runtime (for example, garbage collection type).
    </li>
    <li>The application's dependencies, which are copied from the NuGet cache into the output folder.</li>
  </ul>
  The <code>dotnet publish</code> command's output is ready for deployment to a hosting system (for example, a server, PC, Mac,
  laptop) for execution. It's the only officially supported way to prepare the application for deployment. Depending on the type of
  deployment that the project specifies, the hosting system may or may not have the .NET Core shared runtime installed on it. For
