  The <code>dotnet build</code> command builds the project and its dependencies into a set of binaries. The binaries include the
  project's code in Intermediate Language (IL) files with a <em>.dll</em> extension. Depending on the project type and settings,
  other files may be included, such as:
</div>
<ol>
  <li>
    An executable that can be used to run the application, if the project type is an executable targeting .NET Core 3.0 or later.
  </li>
  <li>Symbol files used for debugging, with a <em>.pdb</em> extension.</li>
  <li>A <em>.deps.json</em> file, which lists the dependencies of the application or library.</li>
  <li>A <em>.runtimeconfig.json</em> file, which specifies the shared runtime and its version for an application.</li>
  <li>Other libraries that the project depends on (via project references or NuGet package references).</li>
</ol>
