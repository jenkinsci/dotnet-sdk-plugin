  The <code>dotnet clean</code> command cleans the output of the previous build. It's implemented as an
  <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-targets">MSBuild target</a>, so the project is evaluated
  when the command is run. Only the outputs created during the build are cleaned. Both intermediate (<em>obj</em>) and final output
  (<em>bin</em>) folders are cleaned.
