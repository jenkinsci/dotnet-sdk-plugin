  Per-test timeout, in milliseconds, after which a hang dump is triggered and the test host process and all of its child processes
  are dumped and terminated.<br/>
  When used together with data driven tests, the timeout behavior depends on the test adapter used. For xUnit and NUnit the timeout
  is renewed after every test case. For MSTest, the timeout is used for all test cases. This option is supported on Windows with
  netcoreapp2.1 and later, on Linux with netcoreapp3.1 and later, and on macOS with net5.0 or later.
  Implies <code>--blame</code> and <code>--blame-hang</code>.
