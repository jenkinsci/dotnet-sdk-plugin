  If enabled, <code>dotnet build-server shutdown</code> will be executed after the main command, shutting down build servers that
  may have been started.

<div>
  Note: If this is not specified, a build that causes such a build server to be started may <q>hang</q> until those server processes
  end. As such, it's recommended to specify this for the last .NET-related step in a job. If using multiple SDKs, each needs its
  own shutdown (e.g. the .NET Core 3.1 SDK will not shut down build servers from the .NET 5.0 SDK).
