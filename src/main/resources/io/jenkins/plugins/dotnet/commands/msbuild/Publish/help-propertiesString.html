  Properties of particular interest to <code>dotnet publish</code>:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <code>PublishProfile=Properties\PublishProfiles\profile.pubxml</code>: Use a <em>.pubxml</em> to set publish-related
      properties. See
      <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/visual-studio-publish-profiles">
        Visual Studio publish profiles (.pubxml) for ASP.NET Core app deployment
      </a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>PublishReadyToRun=true</code>: Compiles application assemblies as ReadyToRun (R2R) format. R2R is a form of
      ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. For more information, see
      <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-core-3-0#readytorun-images">ReadyToRun images</a>.<br/>
      Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>PublishSingleFile=true</code>: Packages the app into a platform-specific single-file executable. The executable is
      self-extracting and contains all dependencies (including native) that are required to run the app. When the app is first run,
      the application is extracted to a directory based on the app name and build identifier. Startup is faster when the application
      is run again. The application doesn't need to extract itself a second time unless a new version is used.<br/>
      For more information about single-file publishing, see the
      <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/designs/blob/master/accepted/2020/single-file/design.md">
        single-file bundler design document
      </a>.<br/>
      Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>PublishTrimmed=true</code>: Trims unused libraries to reduce the deployment size of an app when publishing a
      self-contained executable. For more information, see
      <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trim-self-contained">
        Trim self-contained deployments and executables
      </a>.<br/>
      Available since .NET Core 3.0 SDK.
    </li>
  </ul>
  Note that it is recommended to specify all of these, other than <code>PublishProfile</code>, in a publish profile rather than
  here.
