  The <code>dotnet test</code> command is used to execute unit tests in a given solution. It builds the solution and runs a test
  host application for each test project in the solution. The test host executes tests in the given project using a test framework,
  for example: MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit, and reports the success or failure of each test. If all tests are successful, the test
  runner returns 0 as an exit code; otherwise if any test fails, it returns 1.
</div>
<div>
  For multi-targeted projects, tests are run for each targeted framework. The test host and the unit test framework are packaged as
  NuGet packages and are restored as ordinary dependencies for the project.
