  By default, all build steps provided by the plugin are made available for use both in pipelines and in freestyle projects.

  By unchecking specific commands here, their corresponding step will be hidden from freestyle projects (keeping the list of
  available steps manageable). This <em>does not</em> affect their use in pipelines.

  The <q>With .NET</q> command wrapper always remains available in freestyle projects.
